Most of us have never met in person before but have started contributing to a common or each other&amp;rsquo;s projects! What connects us is the love for building tools that can be used in the neuromorphic community and we want to share ownership of this vision. If you feel like that resonates with you, please don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to get in touch!</description></item><item><title>Events</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/events/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/events/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/img/ONM.png" alt="Featured image of post Events" />2022-12-13: First Edition of ONM On the 13th of December 2022, the first edition of Open Neuromorphic took place! The invited speakers were:
Charlotte Frenkel (slides). Gregor Lenz (slides). Jason Eshraghian. Melika Payvand. Jens Egholm Pedersen (slides). Host: Fabrizio Ottati (slides).
2023-01-26: Applied Brain Research Event description Title: Nengo - Applied Brain Research.
Time: 6PM - 7:30PM CET.
Speaker&amp;rsquo;s bio Trevor Bekolay’s primary research interest is in learning and memory. In his Master’s degree, he explored how to do supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning in networks of biologically plausible spiking neurons.</description></item><item><title>Getting involved</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/getting-involved/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/getting-involved/</guid><description>The easiest way to get in touch is probably through Discord, where we discuss research topics, job opportunities, open hardware, spiking neural network training and much more. We&amp;rsquo;d be delighted to have you join! If you feel like contributing to ONM but you&amp;rsquo;re not exactly sure how, here are some ideas to get you started:
Link an interesting open source repository to our collection so that others can find it too!</description></item><item><title>Opportunities</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/opportunities/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/opportunities/</guid><description>Academia UCSC Neuromorphic Computing Group - University of California Santa Cruz The UCSC Neuromorphic Computing Group is led by professor Jason Eshraghian.
We develop algorithms that can learn, and low-power architectures and circuits that harness exotic device technologies. Our work sits at the intersection of neuroscience, deep learning, and VLSI design. Check out our opportunities page.

Charlotte Frenkel&amp;rsquo;s Laboratory - Delft University of Technology Charlotte Frenkel&amp;rsquo;s researh group aims at bridging the bottom-up (bio-inspired) and top-down (engineering-driven) design approaches toward neuromorphic intelligence, with a focus on spiking neural network processor design, embedded machine learning, and on-chip training algorithms.</description></item><item><title>Resources</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/resources/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/resources/</guid><description>Please check our Github repository for a list of neuromorphic open source software and hardware!</description></item><item><title>Team</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/team/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/team/</guid><description>Fabrizio Ottati Fabrizio Ottati is a Ph.D. student in the Department of Electronics and Communications of Politecnico di Torino, under the supervision of professor Luciano Lavagno and professor Mario Roberto Casu.
His main interests are event-based cameras, digital IC design, spiking neural networks and piedmontese red wine. He is the maintainer of two open source projects in the field of neuromorphic computing, Tonic and Expelliarmus. You can find more information on his website.</description></item></channel></rss>
