Welcome to the Open Neuromorphic Mission Board! The progress of neuromorphic computing is propelled by a vibrant open-source community, but it also faces key challenges in software, interoperability, and tooling. This board is a community-curated list of high-impact challenges where your contributions can make a real difference.

By tackling these issues, you can help support vital open-source tools, prevent maintainer burnout, and directly contribute to the future of the field.

{{< details summary="Project Maintainers: Add Your Project's Tasks" >}}
Are you a maintainer in the neuromorphic ecosystem? We invite you to connect with us to feature your project's tasks and guide community contributions. Hereâ€™s how you can get involved:

#### Step 1: Tag Your GitHub Issues
Our automated system scans for specific tags to populate this board. To have your tasks appear, please add one or more of the following labels to relevant open issues in your GitHub repository:

-   `onm-collab`: For tasks that align with Open Neuromorphic's collaborative goals.
-   `good first issue`: Ideal for newcomers looking to make their first contribution.
-   `documentation`: For tasks related to improving documentation.
-   `bug`: For fixing known issues.
-   `enhancement`: For new features or improvements.
-   `testing`: For adding or improving tests.

The script will automatically pull the three most recent open issues that have at least one of these tags.

#### Step 2: Add Persistent Links (Optional)
If you have important links like a **sponsorship page**, an **onboarding guide**, or other resources you'd like to feature permanently on your project's card, please reach out to us.

-   **Contact Us:** Message an **Executive Committee member** on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/aPFsSRA7Nf) or email us at [contact@open-neuromorphic.org](mailto:contact@open-neuromorphic.org).
-   **Provide Links:** Let us know the title and URL for each link you want to add. We will add them to the `data/community_projects.toml` file for you.

This ensures your project not only gets help with specific tasks but also directs community members to your key resources.
