Welcome to the Open Neuromorphic mission board. The progress of neuromorphic computing is limited by key challenges in software, hardware interoperability, and tooling. To support our vital open-source tools and prevent maintainer burnout, this board highlights key areas where your contributions can make the most impact on the future of the field.
