Welcome to the Open Neuromorphic Mission Board! The progress of neuromorphic computing is propelled by a vibrant open-source community, but it also faces key challenges in software, interoperability, and tooling. This board is a community-curated list of high-impact challenges where your contributions can make a real difference.

By tackling these issues, you can help support vital open-source tools, prevent maintainer burnout, and directly contribute to the future of the field.
