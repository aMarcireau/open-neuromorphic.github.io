Open Neuromorphic thrives on the focused efforts of our community members. **Initiatives** are community-driven projects that tackle specific goals, from developing new resources and tools to organizing event series and improving our digital infrastructure.

Contributing to an initiative is a fantastic way to collaborate with others, gain experience, and make a lasting impact.

## How to Get Involved

### 1. Explore Existing Initiatives

The best way to start is by seeing what's already in motion. We maintain a directory of all active and past community initiatives.

{{< cta-button text="View All ONM Initiatives" link="/neuromorphic-computing/initiatives/" >}}

Each initiative page lists the goals and the key contributors. To get involved, you can:
-   **Join the discussion** on our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/C9bzWgNmqk). Many initiatives have dedicated threads or discussions in relevant channels.
-   **Reach out to the initiative lead(s)** to express your interest and see how you can help.

### 2. Propose a New Initiative

Have an idea that could benefit the neuromorphic community? We strongly encourage members to lead new efforts! Whether it's creating a new tutorial series, benchmarking a new set of tools, or starting a study group, your leadership is welcome.

To propose a new initiative, please follow the instructions on our GitHub repository.

This process helps us formalize the initiative and provide the necessary support and visibility.
