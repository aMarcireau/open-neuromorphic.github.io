## Role Overview
As part of our mission to make neuromorphic computing more accessible, clear and comprehensive documentation is essential. We are looking for volunteers to help us improve our existing documentation and create new content that empowers our community. This is a vital role for lowering barriers to entry for newcomers and supporting autonomous learning.

## Responsibilities
- Review and edit existing hardware/software guides for clarity, accuracy, and completeness.
- Write new tutorials or "getting started" guides for popular neuromorphic tools.
- Help structure and organize content on the website to improve user experience.
- Contribute to the documentation of ONM's open-source projects and internal processes.

## Who We're Looking For
- Individuals with strong technical writing skills and attention to detail.
- Anyone passionate about making complex topics easy to understand.
- Familiarity with neuromorphic concepts is a plus, but not a strict requirement.
- Experience with Markdown and Git/GitHub is helpful.

## How to Apply
To express your interest, please email us at the contact address above with a brief note about your interest and any relevant experience. You can also start contributing directly by opening a pull request on our [website repository](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/open-neuromorphic.github.io).
