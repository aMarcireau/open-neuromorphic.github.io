## Role Overview
Our live events are a cornerstone of community engagement and learning. We are looking for enthusiastic volunteers to help us deliver a great experience for both speakers and attendees. As an Event Support Volunteer, you'll play an active role behind the scenes to ensure our workshops, talks, and coding sessions are successful.

## Responsibilities
- Co-host live sessions on platforms like Discord or StreamYard.
- Moderate the live chat and facilitate Q&A sessions with the speaker.
- Help promote upcoming events on social media and in the Discord community.
- Assist with technical checks and provide support to speakers before and during the event.

## Who We're Looking For
- Individuals who are reliable, organized, and have good communication skills.
- Anyone comfortable in a public-facing role (or interested in gaining experience).
- Familiarity with Discord and live-streaming platforms is a plus, but we can provide guidance.
