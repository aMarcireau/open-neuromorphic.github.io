## Role Overview
The ONM Hardware and Software guides are among our most visited pages. To keep them valuable, we need knowledgeable volunteers to help us track the fast-paced developments in the neuromorphic field. As a curator, you will help ensure our guides are accurate, comprehensive, and up-to-date.

## Responsibilities
- Scan for announcements of new neuromorphic chips, SNN frameworks, or data tools.
- Update existing pages with new specifications, links to papers, or status changes.
- Add new entries to the hardware and software directories following our templates.
- Verify that links to official product pages, source code, and publications are current.
- Collaborate with the community and project maintainers to gather information.

## Who We're Looking For
- Someone with a good understanding of the neuromorphic hardware and software landscape.
- Detail-oriented individuals who enjoy research and fact-checking.
- Familiarity with creating content via Markdown and submitting Pull Requests on GitHub is ideal, but we can assist with the process.
