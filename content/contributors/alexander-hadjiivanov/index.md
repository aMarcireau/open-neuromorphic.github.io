Alex is currently a Research Fellow with the Advanced Concepts Team at the European Space Agency. His research focuses on homeostasis, perception and structural plasticity in classical and spiking neural networks. When he has time, he also works on <a href="https://gitlab.com/EuropeanSpaceAgency/pyrception">Pyrception, an easy way to interface various types of input data with neural networks</a>.

No single branch of AI can claim the crown of true intelligence on its own. Rather, developing AI worthy of the ''I'' would require a concerted effort to combine virtually all the branches - from perception through learning and cognition to reasoning and interaction. The most enticing aspect of neuromorphic computing is its potential to bring about this unification.
