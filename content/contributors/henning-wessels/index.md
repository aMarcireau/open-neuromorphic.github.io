Henning Wessels is Assistant Professor at the Department of Civil and
Environmental Engineering, Technical University Braunschweig, where he is leading
the data-driven modeling group. His group is developing computational methods
at the intersection of mechanics, numerics, machine learning and uncertainty quantification.
Applications can be found, for instance, in virtual sensing and structural health
monitoring. Here, SNN offer huge potential for data-driven mechanics on neuromorphic
hardware within embedded systems.
