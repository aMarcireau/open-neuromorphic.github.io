Lana Josipović is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Information Technology and Electrical Engineering at ETH Zurich. Prior to joining ETH Zurich in January 2022, she received a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science from EPFL, Switzerland. Her research interests include reconfigurable computing and electronic design automation, with an emphasis on high-level synthesis techniques to generate hardware designs from high-level programming languages. She developed Dynamatic, an open-source high-level synthesis tool that produces dynamically scheduled circuits from C/C++ code. She is a recipient of the EDAA Outstanding Dissertation Award, Google Ph.D. Fellowship in Systems and Networking, Google Women Techmakers Scholarship, and Best Paper Award at FPGA'20.
