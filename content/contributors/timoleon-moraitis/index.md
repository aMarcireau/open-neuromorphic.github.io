Dr Timoleon Moraitis has lately focused on demonstrating that the potential of neuromorphic computing extends beyond efficiency, into capabilities and performance that surpass the state of the art in conventional AI. His work with his team ranges from computational neuroscience to deep learning, from theoretical modelling to neuromorphic hardware emulation in nanodevices, and from academic publications to some of the first neuromorphic products in the market. Most recently he led Huawei’s neuromorphic computing group in Zurich, following a position at IBM Research – Zurich. Earlier, during his PhD studies at the Institute of Neuroinformatics (University of Zurich and ETH Zurich), his work included machine learning models of the sensorimotor system, implementation of neuromorphic brain-machine interfaces, surgery and electrophysiology experiments on rats, psychophysics in humans, as well as configuring and using spiking neuromorphic processors.
