Melika Payvand is an Assistant Professor at the Institute of Neuroinformatics, University of Zurich and ETH Zurich. She received her PhD in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of California Santa Barbara.

Her recent research interest is in developing on-device learning systems that form themselves to the sensory input in a real-time fashion. Specifically, she exploits the physics of resistive memory for synaptic, neuronal, dendritic and structural plasticity, inspired by the structure-function relationship of the brain circuits.

Melika is the recipient of the 2023 “Swiss ERC” starting grant and ''Best Neuromorph'' award at 2019 Telluride workshop. She has co-coordinated the European project [NEUROTECH](https://neurotechai.eu), is the program co-chair of the International Conference on Neuromorphic Systems (ICONS) and co-organizes the scientific program of the Capocaccia Neuromorphic Intelligence workshop.
