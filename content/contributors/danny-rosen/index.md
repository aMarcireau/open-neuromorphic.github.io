Danny Rosen is a Master’s student in Computer Engineering at Virginia Tech’s Innovation Campus in Alexandria, Virginia. He’s currently researching Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for edge-based signal processing and has also published work on Reinforcement Learning applied to Cognitive Radio systems.

Danny’s interest in this field started with a curiosity about how the human brain works. That curiosity grew into a passion for neural computation, and he now hopes to explore it further through research in Whole Brain Emulation.
