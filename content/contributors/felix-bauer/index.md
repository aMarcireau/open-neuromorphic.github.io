Felix Bauer is a neuromorphic engineer working on cutting-edge algorithms and chips at [SynSense](https://www.synsense.ai/). He co-authored the [Neuromorphic Intermediate Representation (NIR)](/workshops/neuromorphic-intermediate-representation/) and has published work on GPU-accelerated spiking neural networks via the [Sinabs](/neuromorphic-computing/software/snn-frameworks/sinabs/) simulator, neuromorphic control and brain-machine interfaces.
