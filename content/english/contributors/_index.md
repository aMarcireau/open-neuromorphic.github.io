- description: 'Alexander Henkes received the B.Sc. (Mechanical Engineering) and M.Sc.
    (Mechanical Engineering) degrees from the University of Paderborn, Germany, in
    2015 and 2018, respectively. In 2022, he received his Ph.D. with honors from the
    Technical University of Braunschweig (TUBS), Germany, for his thesis ''Artificial
    Neural Networks in Continuum Micromechanics''.


    In 2022, he was elected as a junior member of the German Association of Applied
    Mathematics and Mechanics (GAMM) for his outstanding research in the field of
    artificial intelligence in continuum micromechanics. In 2023, he won the ETH Zürich
    Postdoctoral Fellowship and joined the Computational Mechanics group at ETH as
    a postdoc.


    His current research focuses on spiking neural networks (SNN). Recently, he published
    a preprint on nonlinear history-dependent regression using SNN. This enables SNN
    to be used in the context of applied mathematics and computational engineering.


    He is a contributor of [snnTorch](https://github.com/jeshraghian/snntorch).'

- description: 'Jens Egholm Pedersen is a doctoral student at the [Royal Institute of
    Technology (KTH)](https://www.kth.se/profile/jeped/) working to model and construct
    [neuromorphic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuromorphic_engineering) control
    systems.


    When faced with the complexity and ambiguity in the real world, contemporary algorithms
    fail spectacularly. There is a strong need for self-correcting, closed-loop systems
    to help solve our everyday physical problems.


    By simulating and carefully scrutinizing and understanding neural circuits, including
    vision, motor control, and self-sustenance, Jens seeks to build autonomous systems
    that perform meaningful work, tightly following the Feynman axiom ''What I cannot
    create, I do not understand''.


    He is the maintainer of [norse](https://github.com/norse/norse) and [AEStream](https:github.com/norse/aestream). '

- description: 'Steve is doing his PhD on neuromorphic computing theory in the [MINDS](https://www.ai.rug.nl/minds/)
    research group at the new [CogniGron](https://www.rug.nl/research/fse/cognitive-systems-and-materials/about/)
    center for cognitive systems and materials in Groningen. He is funded by the European
    [Post-Digital](http://postdigital.astonphotonics.uk/) research network.


    In his PhD, he works with different neuromorphic systems ([Loihi 2](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/research/neuromorphic-computing.html),
    [DynapSE2](https://www.synsense.ai/products/dynap-se2/), and [photonic reservoirs](https://photonics.intec.ugent.be/research/topics.asp?ID=112))
    to develop programming methods for devices that explore a richer set of physical
    dynamics than the synchronous bi-stable switching that (most of) computer science
    relies on. Steve''s background is in computer science and machine learning, with
    a touch of physics.'

- description: 'Alex is currently a Research Fellow with the Advanced Concepts Team at the European Space Agency. His research focuses on homeostasis, perception and structural plasticity in classical and spiking neural networks. When he has time, he also works on <a href="https://gitlab.com/EuropeanSpaceAgency/pyrception">Pyrception, an easy way to interface various types of input data with neural networks</a>.
<br><br>
    No single branch of AI can claim the crown of true intelligence on its own. Rather,
    developing AI worthy of the ''I'' would require a concerted effort to combine
    virtually all the branches - from perception through learning and cognition to
    reasoning and interaction. The most enticing aspect of neuromorphic computing
    is its potential to bring about this unification.'
