## Overview
**mlGeNN** is a new library for machine learning with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), built on the efficient foundation provided by our GeNN simulator. mlGeNN expose the constructs required to build SNNs using an API, inspired by modern ML libraries like Keras, which aims to reduce cognitive load by automatically calculating layer sizes, default hyperparameter values etc to enable rapid prototyping of SNN models.

mlGeNN provides user friendly implementations of novel SNN training algorithms such as e-prop and EventProp  to enable spike-based ML on top of GeNNâ€™s GPU-optimised sparse data structures and algorithms.
