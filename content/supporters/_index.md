## Becoming A Foundational Supporter: The Collaboration Network

We believe that by working together and promoting each other's work, we can elevate the entire field. Our open-source partners help us by linking back to Open Neuromorphic from their project websites, GitHub repositories, or documentation.

This simple act of cross-promotion helps build domain authority and brings more visibility to everyone in the network, creating a virtuous cycle of discovery and growth. In return, we are proud to feature them here and across our platform.

You can support our community by linking back to us. Here are examples you can use in your project website, `README.md`, and generated documentation sites.

### Text Link

A simple text link is a great way to show support. We recommend linking to our main "Neuromorphic Computing" hub.

## Become a Supporter

If your project, lab, or company is interested in joining our mission, we would love to hear from you. We offer various levels of partnership, including direct sponsorship of open-source development.

### Sponsoring Bounties and Projects

One of the most direct ways to support the open-source neuromorphic ecosystem is by sponsoring development. When you click the "Sponsor" button on our [Community Coding Projects board](/getting-involved/solving-neuromorphic-computings-key-challenges/), you can help fund work on that specific tool.

Sponsorship allows us to:
-   **Create Bounties:** Attach financial rewards to critical "help wanted" issues, incentivizing developers to contribute.
-   **Support Maintainers:** Provide resources to the dedicated teams who maintain these essential software libraries.
-   **Accelerate Progress:** Directly fund solutions to the key challenges holding back the field.

To learn more about becoming a supporter or sponsoring a specific project, please reach out to us at [contact@open-neuromorphic.org](mailto:contact@open-neuromorphic.org).
