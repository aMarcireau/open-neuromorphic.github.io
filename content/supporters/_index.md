Open Neuromorphic is built on a foundation of open collaboration. We are proud to partner with a growing network of open-source projects, academic labs, and organizations that share our vision for a more accessible, reproducible, and competitive neuromorphic ecosystem.

## The Collaboration Network

Our **Collaboration Network** is a community-driven initiative based on mutual support. We believe that by working together and promoting each other's work, we can elevate the entire field. Our open-source partners help us by linking back to Open Neuromorphic from their project websites, GitHub repositories, or documentation.

This simple act of cross-promotion helps build domain authority and brings more visibility to everyone in the network, creating a virtuous cycle of discovery and growth. In return, we are proud to feature them here and across our platform.

## Become a Supporter

If your project, lab, or company is interested in joining our mission, we would love to hear from you. We are building a tiered support system, similar to organizations like the Linux Foundation, to offer various levels of partnership.

For now, joining our open-source collaboration network is the first step.
