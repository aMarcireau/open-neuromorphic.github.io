## Overview

Faery is a modern, high-performance Python library designed to streamline the processing of event-based data from neuromorphic cameras. It provides a user-friendly, streaming-first API for loading, filtering, and manipulating event data, treating streams as first-class citizens.

The core of Faery is written in Rust for maximum performance, especially for parsing and I/O-intensive tasks, while offering a flexible and intuitive Python interface. It aims to defragment the neuromorphic ecosystem by providing a standardized tool for handling various event data formats. Its lazy-execution model processes data packet-by-packet, making it efficient for handling large datasets and real-time streams.

Key features include:
- Support for multiple event-data file formats (`.aedat4`, `.es`, `.dat`, `.raw`, `.csv`).
- A rich set of filters for cropping, time-slicing, and data regularization.
- The ability to seamlessly convert between streaming data and static NumPy arrays.
- Tools for rendering event streams into videos and image sequences.

Faery is designed to be the "Initial D" of event processingâ€”fast, efficient, and built to handle the curves of neuromorphic data.
