## Overview
The project aedat on GitHub is a fast AEDAT 4 python decoder with a Rust implementation, allowing users to efficiently read .aedat data files. It facilitates the processing of event-based data, commonly used in neuromorphic computing and vision systems. Users can easily install the library using pip and apply it to read and process frames using popular Python libraries like Pillow and OpenCV. The repository includes examples and detailed instructions on creating decoder objects, iterating through data packets, and handling different types of events or frames. Licensed under MIT, it is an open-source tool designed for flexibility and speed in handling AEDAT files.
