## Overview
Expelliarmus is a specialized Python library focused on decoding binary data from event-based sensors, specifically designed to work with various binary formats prevalent in event cameras like DAT, EVT2, and EVT3. It converts this binary data into NumPy structured arrays, enabling easier manipulation and analysis within the Python ecosystem. This makes it an essential tool for researchers and developers in neuromorphic computing, robotics, and computer vision who rely on event cameras for capturing visual information in the form of events rather than traditional frames.

The library is designed to be cross-platform, functioning seamlessly across Windows, MacOS, and Linux, ensuring broad accessibility and integration into various workflows. Its user-friendly nature is further amplified by its availability on pip, allowing for simple installation and quick setup. The documentation provides benchmarks to demonstrate its performance and efficiency, along with a concise 'getting started' guide that helps new users to quickly adopt the tool for their specific needs.

Expelliarmus supports a range of applications, from academic research in neuromorphic engineering and computer vision to practical implementations in robotics and other areas where real-time, efficient processing of dynamic visual information is crucial. By streamlining the process of decoding and handling event data, Expelliarmus contributes to the broader adoption and application of event-based sensing technologies, promoting more efficient and effective processing of visual information in various technological domains.
