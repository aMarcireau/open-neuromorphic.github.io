The Spikey accelerated neuromorphic system is an integrated circuit architecture for emulating biologically-inspired spiking neural networks.
It was developed by researchers at the Heidelberg University.
Key features of the Spikey system include:

## System Architecture
- Single-chip ASIC integrating a custom analog core with 384 neuron circuits, 98k plastic synapses, analog parameter storage, and an event routing network
- Synapses support STDP-type long-term and STP-type short-term plasticity.

## Neural and Synapse Circuits
- Implements the Leaky Integrate-and-Fire (LIF) neuron model with individually configurable model parameters
- On-chip synapse correlation and plasticity measurement enables programmable spike-timing dependent plasticity

## Applications and Experiments
- Accelerated (50,000–100,000-fold compared to biological real time) emulation of complex spiking neuron dynamics
- Exploration of synaptic plasticity models and critical network dynamics at biological timescales

The accelerated operation and flexible architecture facilitate applications in computational neuroscience research.
