The BrainScaleS-1 accelerated neuromorphic system is an wafer-scale integrated circuit architecture for emulating biologically-inspired spiking neural networks.
It was developed by researchers at the Heidelberg University and collaborators.
Key features of the BrainScaleS-1 system include:

## System Architecture
- 20 wafers comprising 384 ASICs interconnected by a configurable circuit-switched event routing network on a silicon wafer
- Every ASIC integrate a custom analog core with 512 neuron circuits, 112k plastic synapses, floating-gate-based analog parameter storage, STDP-type long-term and STP-type short-term plasticity and an event routing network

## Neural and Synapse Circuits
- Implements the Adaptive Exponential Integrate-and-Fire (AdEx) neuron model with individually configurable model parameters
- On-chip synapse correlation and plasticity measurement enable programmable spike-timing dependent plasticity 

## Software and Experiment Control
- BrainScaleS OS provides a full software stack including:
  - High-level PyNN-based experiment interfaces
  - C++ core libraries for configuration, calibration and control
  - Mapping and routing tools to translate neural models onto hardware
- Allows both novice and expert usage with varying levels of abstraction
- Supports batch-mode and hybrid-mode experiments (chip-in-the-loop)

## Applications and Experiments
- Accelerated (10,000-fold compared to biological real time) emulation of complex spiking neuron dynamics
- Exploration of synaptic plasticity models and critical network dynamics at biological timescales

The accelerated operation and flexible architecture facilitate applications in computational neuroscience research.
