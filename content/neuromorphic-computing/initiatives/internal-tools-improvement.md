The "Internal Tools Improvement" initiative, led by Daniel Rosen, focuses on optimizing the digital infrastructure that supports the Open Neuromorphic community.

The primary objectives are:

*   **Platform Enhancement:** Identifying, evaluating, and implementing improvements to platforms used for communication, project management, and resource sharing (e.g., Discord, GitHub, website backend).
*   **Streamlining Workflows:** Developing and refining processes to make community collaboration more efficient and effective.
*   **Tool Integration:** Ensuring that different tools used by the community work together seamlessly.
*   **User Experience:** Improving the ease of use and accessibility of internal platforms for all community members.

By enhancing our internal tools, this initiative aims to empower members and facilitate smoother operations within ONM.
