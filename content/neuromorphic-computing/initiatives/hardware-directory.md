This initiative was focused on the creation and curation of a comprehensive guide to neuromorphic hardware. The goal was to build a central, open-source repository of information on various neuromorphic chips and platforms, making it easier for researchers and developers to compare systems and find relevant resources.

The outcome of this effort is the **[Neuromorphic Hardware Guide](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/)**, one of our community's most valuable resources.
