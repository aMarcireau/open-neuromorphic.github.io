Proposing a new initiative is a highly encouraged path toward becoming an ONM Fellow. Follow these simple steps to submit your proposal.

## 1. Draft Your Proposal
Use the [Initiative Proposal Template](../initiative-template/) to structure your idea. This ensures all necessary details about the objective, problem statement, and scope are clearly defined.

## 2. Submit via GitHub Pull Request
All initiative proposals are managed in our public [communications repository](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/communications).

- **Create a new file** inside the [`/initiatives/`](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic/communications/tree/main/initiatives) folder of the repository.
- **Name the file** descriptively (e.g., `my-new-initiative.md`).
- **Paste your drafted proposal** into the new file and open a pull request.

## 3. Collaborate and Refine
The Executive Committee and community members will review your proposal in the pull request. This is a collaborative process where you can receive feedback to refine your plan.

Once your proposal is approved, it will be merged and officially listed on our [ONM Initiatives](/neuromorphic-computing/initiatives/) page.
