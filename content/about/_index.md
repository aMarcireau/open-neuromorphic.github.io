## Our Journey & Vision

Open Neuromorphic (ONM) began as a spark – a collective of **open-source** enthusiasts from academia, industry, and individual contributors passionate about advancing neuromorphic computing. What started as a loose network of collaborators, many of whom had never met in person, has blossomed into a vibrant global community.

> Our shared passion is for building, sharing, and learning about tools and technologies that propel the neuromorphic field forward. We believe in the power of open collaboration and shared ownership of this vision.

Our vision is to be the central, community-driven hub for anyone interested in neuromorphic computing – from curious newcomers to seasoned researchers and developers. We aim to break down barriers, foster innovation, and make neuromorphic technology accessible to all.

## What We Offer

ONM is dedicated to providing a comprehensive ecosystem for the neuromorphic community. This includes:

*   **The Neuromorphic Hub:** Our curated guides to [Neuromorphic Hardware](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/) and [Software](/neuromorphic-computing/software/) are designed to help you navigate the landscape and find the tools and platforms you need.
*   **Educational Content & Events:**
    *   Engaging **[Blog Posts](/blog/)** featuring insights, tutorials, and deep dives into neuromorphic topics.
    *   Interactive **[Workshops](/workshops/)** and **[Student Talks](/neuromorphic-computing/student-talks/)** sessions with experts from academia and industry.
    *   Live **[Hacking Hours](/neuromorphic-computing/software/hacking-hours/)** exploring software, tackling coding challenges, and discussing the latest developments.
*   **A Collaborative Platform:**
    *   Our **[GitHub organization](https://github.com/open-neuromorphic)** serves as a platform for open-source neuromorphic projects. We welcome new contributions and can help migrate existing projects.
    *   A thriving **[Discord community](https://discord.gg/C9bzWgNmqk)** for discussions, Q&A, networking, and real-time collaboration.
*   **Clear Project Focus:** We concentrate on projects and resources related to:
    *   Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) for training, inference, Machine Learning, and neuroscience applications.
    *   Event-based sensor data handling and processing.
    *   Digital and mixed-signal neuromorphic hardware designs and concepts.

## Our Governance: The Executive Committee

As Open Neuromorphic has grown, so has the need for a structure to support our community and guide our initiatives. In 2024, we established our first **Executive Committee** to provide leadership, coordinate activities, and ensure the sustainable growth of ONM. This step formalizes our commitment to transparency and community empowerment, as outlined in our [Organisational Charter](charter/).

## Our Founders

Open Neuromorphic was brought to life through the vision and dedication of its founders. Their initial efforts and passion for open-source collaboration laid the groundwork for the thriving community we are today. We are immensely grateful for their pioneering spirit.
