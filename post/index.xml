This is a major reason why your GB-sized raw video can shrink to MBs easily when using video codecs such H.264.
In contrast to conventional cameras, event cameras only record changes in illumination rather than absolut brightness, and therefore output compressed data to begin with.</description></item><item><title>Digital neuromophic hardware read list</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/</link><pubDate>Wed, 11 Jan 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/digital-neuromophic-hardware-read-list/frenkel-thesis.png" alt="Featured image of post Digital neuromophic hardware read list" />Here&amp;rsquo;s a list of articles and theses related to digital hardware designs for neuomorphic applications. I plan to update it regularly. To be redirected directly to the sources, click on the titles!
If you are new to neuromorphic computing, I strongly suggest to get a grasp of how an SNN works from this paper. Otherwise, it will be pretty difficult to understand the content of the papers listed here.

To do so, we will consider a single output neuron connected to multiple input neurons from a previous layer.
In a Spiking Neural Network (SNN), neurons communicate by means of spikes: these activation voltages are then converted to currents through the synapses, charging the membrane potential of the destination neuron.</description></item><item><title>Open Neuromorphic</title><link>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/open-neuromorphic/</link><pubDate>Wed, 21 Dec 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/open-neuromorphic/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://open-neuromorphic.org/p/open-neuromorphic/ONM.png" alt="Featured image of post Open Neuromorphic" />This organisation is created by a loose collective of open source collaborators across academia, industry and individual contributors. What connects us is the love for building tools that can be used in the neuromorphic community and we want to share ownership of this vision.
Open Neuromorphic (ONM) provides the following things:
A curated list of software frameworks to make it easier to find the tool you need. A platform for your code.</description></item></channel></rss>
