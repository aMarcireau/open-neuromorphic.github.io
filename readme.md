This repository contains the source code for the official **Open Neuromorphic (ONM)** website, live at [open-neuromorphic.org](https://open-neuromorphic.org). Our goal is to foster a collaborative community around neuromorphic computing by providing educational content, resources, and a platform for sharing knowledge and projects.

## ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Static Site Generation:** Built with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) (Extended) for speed and security.
*   **Modern Styling:** Styled with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for a utility-first workflow.
*   **Community Focused:** Features contributor profiles, workshops, student talks, and community-led initiatives.
*   **Resource Hubs:** Curated guides for [Neuromorphic Hardware](/neuromorphic-computing/hardware/) and [Software](/neuromorphic-computing/software/).
*   **Automated Deployments:** CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions for automated builds and deployments.
*   **Dynamic OG Images:** Automatically generated Open Graph images for better social sharing.
